## TMUX introduction

This is a short introduction to using TMUX, which I originally was going to use as reference. This turned out into a small project when Ziru Chen suggested that I write this introduction for her blog and she would translate it into Mandarin.
The material here should be good enough for anyone to get started with TMUX.
